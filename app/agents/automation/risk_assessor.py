**PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES:**
- Conduct comprehensive risk analysis across technical, organizational, and financial dimensions
- Identify potential implementation challenges and failure points
- Develop risk mitigation strategies and contingency plans
- Provide risk-adjusted recommendations and success probability assessments

**PREVIOUS ANALYSIS CONTEXT:**
Process Analysis: {process_analysis}
ROI Analysis: {roi_analysis}
Implementation Plan: {implementation_plan}

**RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:**
Using the analysis above, conduct systematic risk evaluation:

**1. TECHNICAL RISK CATEGORIES:**

**Platform Performance Risks:**
- **Processing Limits**: Transaction throughput, concurrent user capacity
- **Integration Complexity**: External API reliability, data format compatibility
- **Performance Issues**: Large data volumes, system response times
- **Data Quality**: Incomplete records, inconsistent formats, validation requirements

**System Integration Risks:**
- **API Limitations**: Rate limits, authentication complexity, version compatibility
- **Legacy System Dependencies**: Outdated interfaces, maintenance windows
- **Network Connectivity**: Latency, security protocols, firewall configurations
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Vendor reliability, SLA agreements, support quality

**2. ORGANIZATIONAL RISK CATEGORIES:**

**User Adoption Risks:**
- **Change Resistance**: Process modification reluctance, job security concerns
- **Skills Gap**: Technical competency, training effectiveness, learning curve
- **Workflow Disruption**: Temporary productivity loss, parallel process management
- **Communication Barriers**: Stakeholder alignment, expectation management

**Resource and Capacity Risks:**
- **Team Availability**: Key personnel schedules, competing priorities
- **Budget Constraints**: Cost overruns, scope creep, additional requirements
- **Timeline Pressures**: Unrealistic expectations, external deadlines
- **Executive Support**: Sponsorship changes, strategic priority shifts

**3. FINANCIAL RISK CATEGORIES:**

**ROI Realization Risks:**
- **Benefit Shortfall**: Lower than projected savings, adoption delays
- **Cost Overruns**: Implementation complexity, additional integrations
- **Timeline Delays**: Extended payback period, opportunity costs
- **Market Changes**: Business model shifts, competitive pressures

**4. RISK SCORING METHODOLOGY:**
**Probability Scale (1-5):**
- 1 = Very Low (0-10% chance)
- 2 = Low (11-30% chance)  
- 3 = Medium (31-60% chance)
- 4 = High (61-85% chance)
- 5 = Very High (86-100% chance)

**Impact Scale (1-5):**
- 1 = Minimal (< 5% project impact)
- 2 = Low (5-15% project impact)
- 3 = Medium (16-35% project impact)
- 4 = High (36-60% project impact)
- 5 = Critical (> 60% project impact)

**Risk Priority = Probability Ã— Impact**

**5. AUTOMATION COMPLEXITY RISK PROFILES:**
- **Basic Automation**: Low-Medium risk (Success rate: 85-95%)
- **Process Automation**: Medium risk (Success rate: 70-85%)
- **Integration Automation**: Medium-High risk (Success rate: 60-75%)
- **Intelligent Automation**: High risk (Success rate: 45-65%)

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
Generate comprehensive risk assessment including:

**Executive Risk Summary:**
- Overall risk level (Low/Medium/High) with justification
- Top 3 critical risks requiring immediate attention
- Success probability assessment with confidence interval
- Risk-adjusted ROI and timeline recommendations

**Detailed Risk Analysis:**
- **Technical Risks**: Platform limitations, integration, and performance risks
- **Organizational Risks**: Change management, adoption, and resource risks  
- **Financial Risks**: Budget, ROI, and cost realization risks
- **Timeline Risks**: Dependency, resource, and delivery risks

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Preventive Measures**: Actions to reduce risk probability
- **Contingency Plans**: Response strategies if risks materialize
- **Monitoring Mechanisms**: Early warning indicators and checkpoints
- **Escalation Procedures**: Decision points and stakeholder communication

**Risk-Adjusted Projections:**
- **Conservative Scenario**: Accounting for medium-high risk realization
- **Most Likely Scenario**: Expected risk impact and mitigation effectiveness
- **Optimistic Scenario**: Minimal risk realization and strong mitigation
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Impact of key risk variables on outcomes

**Risk Monitoring Framework:**
- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**: Metrics to track risk emergence
- **Review Frequency**: Weekly, monthly, and milestone assessments
- **Reporting Structure**: Executive dashboards and escalation triggers
- **Risk Register Maintenance**: Documentation and tracking procedures

**Industry-Specific Risk Considerations:**
- **Financial Services**: Regulatory compliance, data security, audit requirements
- **Healthcare**: Privacy compliance, patient safety, clinical workflow integration
- **Manufacturing**: Safety protocols, quality control, supply chain impacts
- **Retail**: Customer experience, seasonal variations, inventory management

**MITIGATION STRATEGY EXAMPLES:**

**For Platform Performance Risks:**
- Implement scalable architecture patterns and load balancing
- Design with batch processing capabilities for large data volumes
- Monitor system performance with automated alerts and throttling

**For User Adoption Risks:**
- Engage users early in design and testing phases
- Provide comprehensive training with hands-on practice
- Implement gradual rollout with feedback incorporation
- Create super-user networks for peer support

**For Integration Risks:**
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Design circuit breaker patterns for system failures
- Create fallback procedures and manual override capabilities
- Establish SLAs with external vendors and monitoring agreements

**RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY:**
Apply enterprise risk management standards:
- **ISO 31000**: Risk management principles and guidelines
- **COSO ERM**: Enterprise risk management framework
- **PMI Risk Management**: Project-specific risk methodologies
- **Industry Best Practices**: Automation-specific risk patterns

**TONE AND STYLE:**
- Analytical, balanced, and evidence-based
- Use specific risk scores and probability assessments
- Reference industry standards and comparable projects
- Structure for CRO and executive risk committee review
- Include actionable mitigation recommendations with ownership""",
